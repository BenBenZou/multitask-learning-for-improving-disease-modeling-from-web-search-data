# Multi-Task Learning for Improving Disease Modeling from Web Search

Here we provide supplementary material for the paper Multi-Task Learning for Improving Disease Modeling from Web Search [1].

The page <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binzou-ucl/google-flu-mtl/master/queries.csv">queries.csv</a> lists all the search queries considered in our experiments together with their similarity score to the specified flu context (see Section 3.1 of the paper for more information).

The page <a href="https://github.com/binzou-ucl/google-flu-mtl/blob/master/extended-table1-L%3D1.md">table1_exp.txt</a> presents an expanded version of Table 1 in our paper, where we show detailed performance results for all 10 US regions during the 4 test periods (using L = 1 years of training data).
