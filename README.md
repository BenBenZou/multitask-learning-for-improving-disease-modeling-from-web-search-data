# Multi-Task Learning for Improving Disease Modeling from Web Search

Here we provide some supplementary material for the paper Multi-Task Learning for Improving Disease Modeling from Web Search [1].

The page <a href="URL">queries.csv</a> lists all the search queries considered in our experiments together with their similarity score to the specified flu context (see Section 3.1 of the paper for more information).

The page <a href="URL">table1_exp.txt</a> presents an expanded version of Table 1 in our paper, where we show detailed performance results for all 10 US regions during the 4 test periods (using L = 5 years of training data).
